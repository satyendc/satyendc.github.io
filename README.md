# Personal Profile - Neo-Glass Dashboard

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website with a "Neo-Glass" aesthetic, featuring dark mode, glassmorphism, and neon accents.

## 🚀 How to Run

Since this is a static website (HTML/CSS/JS), you can run it in multiple ways:

### Option 1: The Simplest Way (Double Click)
1. Go to the project folder: `C:\Users\DELL\OneDrive\Desktop\Profile`
2. Double-click on **`index.html`**.
3. It will open in your default web browser.

### Option 2: Using Python (Recommended for best experience)
If you have Python installed (which you do!), you can run a local server:

1. Open your terminal in this folder.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

### Option 3: VS Code Live Server
If you are using Visual Studio Code:
1. Install the "Live Server" extension.
2. Right-click on `index.html`.
3. Select "Open with Live Server".

## 🛠️ Customization
- **Edit Info**: Open `index.html` to change names, links, and text.
- **Edit Styles**: Open `styles.css` to tweak colors (look for `:root` variables at the top).
